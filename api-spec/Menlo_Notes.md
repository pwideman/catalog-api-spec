* Query Language
  * Filters
  	* GraphQL - too explicit on projections
	* Custom - Follows industry trend of "Not Invented Here", but can by opinionated on simpifying query (no joins or aggregations). Low barrier to entry. Complicated Query language can be an additional extension

Implicit equals if no operators are present.
		
Custom Query Example
```
{
"query": {
    "eo:cloud_cover": {
      "lt": 50
    },
    "provider": "Planet",
    "published": {
      "date": "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
    },
    "pl:item_type": {
      "startsWith": "PSScene"
    }
  }
}
```
		
  * Sorting ?
```
{
  "sort": {
    "eo:cloud_cover": "asc", // ascending
    "provider": "desc" //descending
  }
}
```
  * Projections  
  	include prop names and exclude prop names as separate lists
	
	include should be applied before exclude
```
{
  "include": [""],
  "exclude": [""]
}
```
	
* STAC Browser
Add a new /stac endpoint to return catalog.json
```
{
    "name": "NAIP",
    "description": "Catalog of NAIP Imagery - 30087",

    "links": [
        { "rel": "self", "href": "https://mycatalog/stac" },
        { "rel": "child", "href": "stac?page=2"},
        { "rel": "item", "href": "../collections/NAIP/items/m_3008718_sw_16_1_20130805" },
        { "rel": "item", "href": "../collections/NAIP/items/m_3008718_sw_16_1_20130806" },
        ...
    ]
}
```

So the STAC Dynamic API will consist of 
* `/stac` (catalog endpoint described above which is compatible with Static STAC)
* `/stac/search` (existing search endpoint that we know and love)


* Collection integration

	* Search endpoint should be able to return a denormalized metadata model. Queries should use property names that would be expected in the denormalized metadata structure.
	* The returned items do not need to be denormalized by default. The "projection" argument would be used to control the returned properties.
